# Movie-Website
This is the code that powers a simple movie website. It uses Python (3.6) and styled by a fresh_tomato file (written in 

Python, HTML, and CSS) provided by Udacity.

## Installation guide
The following is expecting you to have python 3.x installed on your machine. If you haven't, check out this:

http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/

# Download code
You can download the code and open it with a text editor of your choice. 

To download, simply click the clone/ download button on the right-hand corner under number of contributor.

On your `terminal`, copy and run the following:

`> git clone https://github.com/axtang/Movie-Website.git`

The code was written on Sublime and tested on Chrome only. 

It is preferred to be run on `IDLE` to generate the web page.

## More information
I have chosen to not print them out, yet, until I have complete furnishing the other features of this website.

My goal is to polish this website into a platform, where link of streaming movies, lists of showtimes, and maps to nearest 

movie theaters are available in a few clicks.

### For reviewers
Apologies in advance for non-functional Interstellar movie trailer link. Due to movie license restriction, playback on certain 

sites (including this one) does not work.

### Acknowledgements
Hat tip to Udacity for enabling me to build this website.

And thank you for visiting this website.
