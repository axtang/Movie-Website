# Movie-Website
This is the code that powers a simple movie website. It was written in Python and a fresh_tomato file (written in Python, HTML, and CSS) provided by Udacity.

# Features
This website is extremely minimal. Posters of several of my all time favorite movies are listed on this website. If you click into these posters, the respective trailers for that movie will pop up and play on your screen.

# Upcoming Moves
Included in the code are also the movie names, movie description, movie genre, and movie duration. I have chose to not print them out, yet, until I have complete furnishing the other features of this website.

My goal is to polish this website into a platform, where link of streaming movies, lists of showtimes, and maps to nearest movie theaters are available in a few clicks.

Apologies in advance for non-functional Interstellar movie trailer link. Due to movie license restriction, playback on certain sites (including this one) does not work.

Additionally, the instancemovie.py might not fully pass PEP8 checkout because the movie trailer links are too long. After consulting with a mentor, it is best leaving these links as they are than cutting them up to fulfil the PEP8 requirements.
