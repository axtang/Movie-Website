# Movie-Website
This is the code that powers a simple movie website. I written in Python (3.6) and it was styled by a fresh_tomato file (written in Python, HTML, and CSS) provided by Udacity.

# Features
This website is extremely minimal. Posters of several of my all time favorite movies are listed on this website. If you click into these posters, the respective trailers for that movie will pop up and play on your screen.

The classmovie.py contains code for a constructor that runs all the movie information included in instance movie.py. The code from these files are executed by fresh_tomatoes.py to generate a website/ file -- fresh_tomatoes.html.

# Getting Started
Feel free to download and run this code with a text editor of your choice. I used Sublime and the code was only tested on Chrome.

## Upcoming Moves
Included in the code are also the movie names, movie description, movie genre, and movie duration. I have chosen to not print them out, yet, until I have complete furnishing the other features of this website.

My goal is to polish this website into a platform, where link of streaming movies, lists of showtimes, and maps to nearest movie theaters are available in a few clicks.

### For reviewers
Apologies in advance for non-functional Interstellar movie trailer link. Due to movie license restriction, playback on certain sites (including this one) does not work.

Additionally, the instancemovie.py might not fully pass PEP8 checkout because the movie trailer links are too long. After consulting with a mentor, it is best leaving these links as they are than cutting them up to fulfil the PEP8 requirements.

### Acknowledgements
Hat tip to Udacity for enabling me to providing me with the knowledge and partially, code, to build this website.
